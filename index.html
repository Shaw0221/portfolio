          <p class="info">
            I am currently a student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design program. I will be able to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as use tools such as Shopify, Drupal, and Wordpress in order to create websites and interfaces for clients. I was also briefly in their Computer Engineering program, and so I have a bit of knowledge on the inner workings of computers and a few other coding languages such as Python and Java.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            I have always had a passion for working with technology, coding, and design, and I have worked very hard in order to learn and to grow as a programmer. Creating websites for me is a wonderful and interesting thing for me, and so being able to help people create websites for their business, for themselves, or even just for fun, will always be a joy.
          </p>

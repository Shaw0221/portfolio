# portfolio

In order to create this portfolio, it first required me to draw a small, simple mockup of the website and it's pages, and then break it down into smaller parts so that I may take a step back and work on it piece by piece so that way it was easier for me to work on. Afterwards, I began compiling all of the resources and information I would require in order to get started, such as images, fonts, and any other outside resources that I might need. 

After that, I chose a section of the portfolio to work on first, and after finishing that moved on to the next bit, and so on and so forth until most of the portfolio was complete. I decided to showcase some of my work from my Content Management Systems course so that I could show not just my skills with coding, but also my skills in using software/websites to design and interface other websites. While working on the home page, I also remembered a tutorial for a typewriter text animation using HTML and CSS that I thought would looks amazing in the website, so I used that and arranged the animation to display my own custom text.

Lastly, once I had finished all of the HTML and CSS, I took time to look through the code and organize as well as clean up the code to make it easier to read, as well as to navigate.


Some of the challenges I faced while doing this assignment definitely have to stem from an issue I had with breaking down assignments into smaller parts so that I did not become overwhelmed and not be able to do the assignment. However, thankfully I had scheduled an appointment with a Learning Strategist, and learned different techniques and habits that I used to circumvent this issue I had.

Another challenge I faced while doing this assignment was that part of this assignment stated that it required that I create and submit a mockup of the website using quote "mockups, wireframes and design elements you create in your User Experience Design course". The issue arising in the fact that I had not taken this course yet. And so to solve this, I emailed my professor about this and he stated that I would not be required to submit a mockup, but may still use one for reference if needed, as well as discuss with classmates if there are any issues.
